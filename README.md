CryptoFriends
----

CryptoFriends is the secure psuedo-anonymous decentralized friendship network.

It uses the currency FriendBits, which can be used to send requests ~~and make posts~~. Posts can be made to your friends for free, but to share with those not in your nest you'll have to drop some FriendBits? Hows that sound guys?
